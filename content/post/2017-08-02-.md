It was class 5th when Computers were first installed in our school. We were all looking at our principle room it is also our Computer lab form then. I wasn&#8217;t aware about computer at that time. One of my friend told me that in Computers there are games and paint music and animation etc.. His main focus was on the word &#8220;Games&#8221;. I haven&#8217;t played any virtual game till then.
